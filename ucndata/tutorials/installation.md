This analysis package relies on relatively few prerequisites. The main one is that [ROOT must be installed](https://root.cern/install/) with PyROOT functionality. Note that ROOT must have been compiled with the same version of python that you will be using for your analysis.


Afterwards, some python packages are needed. Run the following to install:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas rootloader tqdm
```

Then, you're ready to get started.
